# Gabaix-Seminar-Paper

This is a new repository for the seminar paper. The paper uses Trabandt's LaTeX template, which contains multiple different .tex files.
There is a .tex file for each component of the paper. E.g. title.tex, introduction.tex or appendix.tex
All of the sections of the paper will also require their own .tex file, so it take some time to get everything organized.

The paper itself is called gabaixSeminarPaper.tex and it requires all of the other files in order to work properly. It is therefore very important when changing the title of a .tex file, because the main script will still search for the old name.
